#--------------------------------------------About and Functions-------------------------------------------------------------------
#As you Know, Steam Locomotives have Gas or Steam Generators for Electricity. So, I have taken the liberty to make this Functioning E2.
#This E2 Powers Lamps. Wire Lights and Headsplight can Also Work, but Lamps are your best freind.
#Simply Wire the Inputs of the Lamp or Other Lighting Entitys you Wish, and Configure the E2 With the Configurator Above. 

#Functions:

#Sound = the Sound that plays when the Dynamo or Generator is Turned On.

#RampUpSpeed = Controls the Speed at which the Sound Pitch Increases. 1 - 3 is a Good Number. The Higher the Number, the Faster.

#RampUpSpeed = Controls the Speed at which the Sound Pitch Decreases. 1 - 3 is a Good Number. The Higher the Number, the Faster.

#Limit = Controls What Pitch the Dynamo Rises To.

#RevDecreaseLimiter = Wire this to an Input and it will Stop the Pitch from Decreasing.
#Turning it off will make the pitch decrease back to 0.

#Brightness = This is what Controls How Bright the Lamp Will be once it reaches full pitch on the Limit input. This only works on lamps.

#FOV = This is what Controls the Reccomended FOV of the Lamp.This only works on lamps.

#Distance = This is what Controls the Reccomended Distance of the Lamp.This only works on lamps.

#Red1, Red2, Green1, Green2, Blue1, Blue2 = This Controls the Color Vectors of the Lamp/Light/Splight.
#Theres 2 For the elimination of having to use 2 E2s.

#------------------------------------Dont Touch the Code. This is its No No Square-----------------------------------------------------
